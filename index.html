										<h2>Interests</h2>
										<p>My interest in IT started when I got my first Playstation when I was 7 years old and when we got our first family computer (Windows 95 operating system) shortly after. Growing up I was obsessed with different types of computer hardware, programs and video games consoles, and for the Christmas of 2019 I bought myself computer components and built a gaming computer, which I now want to learn to fully utilise. Due to my lifelong interest in this field, I am currently looking to pursue IT as a career.</p>
										<p>I chose to study at RMIT because of my previous experience with the university. I found the study environment to be conducive to my learning. Given my ongoing full-time employment, this online course suited my lifestyle and requirements, due to the flexibility of the course.</p>
										<p>During my studies I expect to gain an in depth understanding of most aspects of general IT related fields, and a more complex and thorough understanding of programming and other specialist areas. Additionally, I would like to further develop my industry-based skills including communication and teamwork, helping me to become an IT professional.</p>

							<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
							<p>The most interesting test result for me was the career test result. It confirmed that IT is the career path that I would be most suited for and that is why have chosen IT as a course. As a Logistician personality type I am well suited to many different types of groups and organisations due to my values. When forming a team or looking to join a company, I would align myself with places that have more traditional, no-nonsense views. I would seek out places that value hard work, dedication and loyalty.</p>

									<h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
									<p>“The Logistician personality type is thought to be the most abundant, making up around 13% of the population. Their defining characteristics of integrity, practical logic and tireless dedication to duty make Logisticians a vital core to many families, as well as organisations that uphold traditions, rules and standards, such as law offices, regulatory bodies and military. People with the Logistician personality type enjoy taking responsibility for their actions, and take pride in the work they do – when working towards a goal, Logisticians hold back none of their time and energy completing each relevant task with accuracy and patience.”</p>

							<h1>Project</h1>
							<p>My project idea is a mattress protector that can detect varying amounts of pressure, how long that pressure has been applied for and also has a built-in bedwetting alarm. The aim is to try and reduce the initial risk of pressure ulcers, common in hospitals and nursing homes, if not totally eradicate them. “Pressure sores are areas of damage to the skin and the underlying tissue caused by constant pressure or friction. This type of skin damage can develop quickly to anyone with reduced mobility, such as older people or those confined to a bed or chair”</p>
							<p>If this product is used before the onset of pressure ulcers, it will help reduce the chances of ever getting one. If pressure ulcers occur, this mattress protector will help prevent the ulcers from degenerating into a worse grade of ulcer and actually help treat them. The mattress protector's primary function will be to detect the amount of pressure applied to every area of a mattress, and to monitor the amount of time the pressure has been applied for. Its secondary function will be able to detect the weight on top of it and if there has been any liquid that has come into contact with it. If liquid contact occurs, the user will be alerted. The product will then be able to store these metrics so that they can be accessed at will via an app.</p>
							<p>This product is useful as it has some real-world applications that can make a big difference to the lives of people across Australia. According to Rodgers, Sim and Clifton, “the overall prevalence of pressure injuries in acute-care hospitals in Australia and New Zealand is 12.9% and the hospital-acquired pressure injury prevalence is 7.9%” (Rodgers, Sim & Clifton, 2020, para. 4). The main demographic for this product will be anyone who is bedridden for a prolonged period of time due to age or sickness, therefore, the biggest target for this product will be nursing homes and hospitals. This product will appeal to people who are at risk of developing pressure sores and their carers. Using this product will bring peace of mind to families and their loved ones when they need it the most.</p>
							<p>This product will have two main parts to it. The first part is the mattress protector which is the hardware. The second is the software, an application in which you can access all the information that the product has stored. The mattress protector will have to record four different sets of data. The metrics being measured are weight, pressure and time. It will also store data on the bedwetting if liquid contact occurs. The mattress protector will have to be plugged into a power source. All sensors inside the mattress protector will be housed in a waterproof cover that will be made from a thermoplastic polyurethane variant. The power lead will have a switch where you can turn the protector on and off, similar in design to an electric blanket. Where the power lead connects to the protector, you will be able to disconnect the lead, leaving a waterproof terminal leading into the mattress protector. The waterproof cover will be detachable to the sensors inside so that it can be washed independently of the electronics. Near the power switch there will be a housing for the Bluetooth receiver and the storage device for the data recorded by the sensors. These will be connected to the sensors by a cord which runs parallel to the power cord connecting to the mattress protector. The bed wetting alarm will be triggered by a sensor outside of the waterproofing located half way down the mattress protector. The sensor will be able to be moved up and down the mattress via a retractable cord to accommodate people of all sizes. This sensor will be detachable for ease of use when washing the unit.</p>
							<p>The application will extract data via Bluetooth from the transmitter connected to the mattress protector. This application will be quite simple in design. When you first install and use the application, it will prompt you to set up one or more mattress protectors by connecting to them and customising the name of the unit. Once setup is complete the app will have three tabs, weight, pressure imaging and bedwetting. Each tab will have a live feed for these sensors and a recorded feed of the past week. The weight tab will give you a basic rundown of the weight of the user 3 times a day. The pressure imaging data will be the main focus of this application, showing a number of data sets in the form of pressure imaging. This first will be a time lapsed recording of the pressure sensor showing movement over a pre-selected period of time. The next will be a pressure image showing the areas where the most pressure has been put during a pre-selected period of time. This metric will tell the user where they need to check for pressure ulcers and where they need to remove pressure or correct bad posture. The bedwetting tab will have an extra feature where it will store what times of the day and night this sensor has been activated and tell the user when the patient will need to go to the toilet based off previous incidents.</p>
							<p>This project will require a hardware engineer and front-end software developer. On the hardware front, the bedwetting alarm is an easy feature to implement but the weight and pressure tracking will require specialist skills in order to create a working prototype. The hardware required to measure weight via a flexible surface such as a sheet has been created and so too has the hardware to measure pressure on a mattress but it will be challenging to find an individual with the skills to create the hardware to make this design a reality. If this project is successful, it will revolutionise the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers. This technology in time will be able to evolve using specially designed algorithms to predict the onset of pressure ulcers, while the hardware would be able to be integrated into current designs of mattresses that use inflatable cushions to relieve pressure from certain areas of the body in the treatment and prevention of pressure ulcers.</p>
